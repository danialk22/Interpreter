# Interpreter
This code is an interpreter for a code given as text input in Javascript. The interpreter reads in the source code, line by line, and processes each instruction. It analyses the syntax and semantics of the code, and performs the appropriate actions based on the instructions given. It then executes the code, and provides output to the user.
